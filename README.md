This project is a simple To-Do List app built using React. I created this app to practice and improve my React skills, including managing components, using state, and managing events.
Regarding the functionality, I made it functional to be able to add a new note and delete it

It's simple because I did it just to practice more ... 

PS. the "node_modules" have not been uploaded, because of its size
